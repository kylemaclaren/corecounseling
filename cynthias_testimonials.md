# Cynthia's Testimonials

*"My work with Cynthia has been profound and joyful.  I thank her for her tremendous compassion, great wisdom, and deep spirit.  Because of her interdisciplinary background in Shamanism, Buddhism, psychology and hypnotherapy, Cynthia brings many tools and much richness to our work together.  I have had breakthroughs with her that I‚ve never experienced with other therapists.  She is an incredible guide in helping me discover and explore new paths to self-understanding and spiritual growth."*

Cynthia's words somehow go straight to your heart."*

She radiates the kind of compassion that can only come from years of practice, and is also gifted with a rare quality of insight that might better be called, 'wisdom'.

True healing magic occurs."*
