# Couples Counseling

When couples come in for counseling, they are often experiencing a situation in which each individual has been triggered into an intolerable state, or reactive pattern. This pattern involves beliefs, feelings and specific sensations, and is so powerful it can blind couples to the truth of what is actually occurring in the moment.

With gentle guidance, I help the individuals to recognize their reactive patterns and to see how they trigger their partner's response. I teach communication skills to enable the couple to dialogue effectively when they feel threatened by reactivity.

Fostering a climate of kindness and empathy enables couples to communicate clearly and lovingly, and to learn to listen to one another in a new way.
