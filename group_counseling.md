# Group Counseling 

**8-Week Groups for Women**  
*<span class="orange">Berkeley, California</span>*

In small groups we use dialogue, gentle visualization exercises and structured group work to facilitate personal transformation and re-alignment with core values. As we are witnessed by others, we step into our power in a profound, irreversible way.

We are mirrors for each other, and in this way each one of us is a teacher.

Medicine Work is:

- Stepping into your power
- Being witnessed in your authenticity
- Releasing your self-defeating patterns
- Reconnecting with your soul's purpose
