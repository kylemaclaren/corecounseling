# Core Integration

Core Integration is compiled from the traditions of Jungian psychology, Buddhist meditation and ancient shamanic practices. It is a compassionate, collaborative process designed to integrate the conflicting forces we carry within us and enable us to live richly and authentically from the Core Self.

With Core Integration you can:

- Discover powerful inner resources
- Release self-defeating patterns
- Reconnect with life purpose
- Access internal guidance
- Embody the core self

Private sessions available for [individuals](core_counseling.html), [couples](couples_counseling.html) and [groups](group_counseling.html).
